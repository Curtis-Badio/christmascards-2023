    <h1>Enter Your Name</h1>
<h3>Please enter your first name for individuals and last names for families. For small screen viewing, please have your phone in landscape orientation, then click on the card once it pops up. For large screen viewing, hover over the card. Large screen is advised. The site looks boring because I spent too much time on the JavaScript and HTML stuff and not enough time on the CSS part, lol.</h3>
<h2>I did code this site myself, but anyone is free to ask for the code files anytime. I believe that sharing code with humans (not AI) helps everyone achieve new strengths.</h2>
